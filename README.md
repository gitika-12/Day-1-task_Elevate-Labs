# Flight Data Cleaning Project 

For this task, I took an uncleaned flights dataset from Kaggle and performed a complete data cleaning process to prepare it for analysis.  
The cleaned dataset can now be used for further exploration, visualization, and modeling.

## Dataset Source
- Original dataset: Flights Dataset on Kaggle
- Format: CSV

## Tools Used
- *Excel*
- Kaggle dataset

## Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Loaded the Dataset**
   - Imported the CSV file from Kaggle.

2. **Handled Missing Values**
   - Identified columns with missing values.
   - Removed rows with too many missing values.

3. **Removed Duplicates**
   - Checked for duplicate rows.
   - Dropped duplicates to avoid repetition.

4. **Corrected Data Types**
   - Converted flight price column type to Indian Rupee Currency format.
   - Changed numerical columns stored as text into numeric data types.

5. **Standardized Column Names**
   - Renamed columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores for consistency.

8. **Exported the Cleaned Dataset**
   - Saved the cleaned version.
